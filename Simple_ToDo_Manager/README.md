###📘 Code Breakdown
###📁 Importing Module

import os
Imports the os module to check if the to-do file exists.

🗂 File Configuration

to_do_file = "to_do_list.txt"
Specifies the file where tasks will be stored.

📥 Load Tasks

def load_task():
    if not os.path.exists(to_do_file):
        return []
    with open(to_do_file, "r") as file:
        tasks = file.readlines()
    return [task.strip() for task in tasks]
Checks if the file exists.

Reads all tasks and removes newline characters using strip().

💾 Save Tasks

def save_task(tasks):
    with open(to_do_file, "w") as file:
        for task in tasks:
            file.write(task + '\n')
Overwrites the task file with the current list of tasks.

➕ Add Task

def add_task(task):
    tasks = load_task()
    tasks.append(task)
    save_task(tasks)
    print(f"Task {task} added")
Loads current tasks, appends new task, saves back to file.

⚠️ There's a small typo: Task{task}added should be Task {task} added

👁️ View Tasks

def view_task():
    tasks = load_task()
    if not tasks:
        print("No tasks found")
    else:
        print("Your to-do list is below:")
        for idx, task in enumerate(tasks, start=1):
            print(f"{idx}. {task}")
Loads tasks and prints them with numbering.

Handles the case where the task list is empty.

❌ Delete Task

def del_task(task_number):
    tasks = load_task()
    if 1 <= task_number <= len(tasks):
        remove_task = tasks.pop(task_number - 1)
        save_task(tasks)
        print(f"Task {remove_task} deleted")
    else:
        print("Invalid task")
Removes the task by its number (user sees tasks starting at 1).

Handles out-of-range values.

🧠 Main Menu Loop

def main():
    while True:
        print("\nTo Do List Application")
        print("1. Add Task")
        print("2. View Task")
        print("3. Delete Task")
        print("4. Exit")
Displays a looping menu for task operations.


        choice = input("Choose an Option (1-2-3-4): ")
Takes user input for action.


        if choice == "1":
            task = input("Enter The Task: ")
            add_task(task)
        elif choice == "2":
            view_task()
        elif choice == "3":
            task_number = int(input("Enter The Task Number to Delete: "))
            del_task(task_number)
        elif choice == "4":
            print("Exiting The Application")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid Choice. Please Choose a Valid Option.")
Handles each choice, including input validation and exiting.
